This is Task1 for Practical Econometrics II course made by Milda Zarankaite. 
The code was taken from the source: http://www.harding.edu/fmccown/r/ and the whole task was made by an example from: http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/rmarkdown.html

1. Define the cars vector with 5 values
```{r}
cars <- c(1, 3, 6, 4, 9)
```
2. Graph cars using blue points overlayed by a line
```{r,  echo=FALSE}
plot(cars, type="o", col="blue")
```
